# Overview & Concept

This is the beginning of a project i am creating for TrickNastics Academy.  
This allows for people to sign up to the TrickNastics Academy mailing list were they then can recieve further updates about content.

# Technologies Used
I used react as my front end framework.
Bootstrap for handling the CSS.
Running on a heroku server using mailchimp API for the backend.


# Approach Taken(Thought process & methods of producing it, show where you took the lead)
I started this solo project by thinking how could i keep a track on peoples customer details, this made building and comunicating with customers easier as there is databse that is collected.
